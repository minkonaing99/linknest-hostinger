# Link Nest Data Flow

Last updated: 2026-04-14

This document explains how data moves through Link Nest during the main user actions.

It focuses on the real current code paths, not an idealized future design.

## Overview

Link Nest is a multi-page web app backed by a small Node.js HTTP server and Supabase (PostgreSQL).

At a high level, most actions follow this pattern:

```text
Browser UI
  -> page script in public/js/
  -> HTTP request to /api/...
  -> lib/router.js
  -> auth check if needed
  -> domain logic in lib/auth.js or lib/links.js
  -> Supabase (PostgreSQL)
  -> JSON response
  -> UI re-render in browser
```

## Main request layers

### Frontend

The frontend is split by page:

- `public/js/home.js`
- `public/js/browse.js`
- `public/js/editor.js`
- `public/js/archive.js`
- `public/js/login.js`
- `public/js/shared.js`

These scripts collect user input, call the API, and update the DOM.

### Routing layer

`lib/router.js` receives each request and decides:

- which route matches
- whether auth is required
- which domain function to call
- how to format the response

### Domain layer

Main backend logic lives in:

- `lib/auth.js`
- `lib/links.js`
- `lib/title.js`
- `lib/utils.js`

### Persistence layer

`lib/db.js` initializes the Supabase connection pool and exposes a `query()` helper used by all domain modules. Tables:

- `links`
- `users`
- `sessions`
- `refresh_tokens`

## Flow 1: Browser login

### User action

The user submits the login form in `public/login.html`.

### Frontend path

`public/js/login.js` sends:

```text
POST /api/login
```

with:

- `username`
- `password`

### Backend path

`lib/router.js` handles `/api/login` and:

1. checks login rate limit using `lib/ratelimit.js`
2. parses the JSON body
3. calls `authenticateUser()` from `lib/auth.js`
4. if valid, calls `createSession()`

### Database activity

- reads the user from `users`
- stores a hashed session token in `sessions`

### Response

The server:

- returns `{ ok: true, user }`
- sets an HTTP-only session cookie

### Browser result

`login.js` redirects the user to:

```text
/browse.html
```

## Flow 2: Load a protected page

### User action

The browser opens `/`, `/browse.html`, `/editor.html`, or `/archive.html`.

### Backend path

`lib/router.js` checks whether the page is protected.

If yes:

1. it calls `requireAuth()` from `lib/auth.js`
2. auth is resolved by checking:
   - bearer token first
   - session cookie second

### Outcome

- authenticated user: page HTML is served
- unauthenticated user: browser is redirected to `/login.html`

## Flow 3: Quick add from the home page

### User action

The user pastes a URL into the quick-add form on the home page.

### Frontend path

`public/js/home.js` does two API calls.

#### Step 1: fetch metadata

```text
GET /api/fetch-title?url=...
```

#### Step 2: save the link

```text
POST /api/links
```

### Backend path for title fetch

`lib/router.js` -> `fetchTitleForUrl()` in `lib/links.js`

That function:

1. normalizes the URL
2. checks that it resolves to a public address
3. derives the host
4. calls `fetchTitle()` in `lib/title.js`

### Backend path for create link

`lib/router.js` -> `createLink()` in `lib/links.js`

That function:

1. sanitizes the payload with `sanitizeEntry()`
2. normalizes URL and tags
3. checks for duplicate URL
4. inserts the new link

### Database activity

- reads from `links` to detect duplicate URL
- writes the new document into `links`

### Browser result

- success message is shown
- home page reloads recent links

## Flow 4: Add or edit link from the editor page

### Create flow

`public/js/editor.js` sends:

```text
POST /api/links
```

### Edit flow

`public/js/editor.js` loads existing data through `window.LinkNest.getLinks()` and then sends:

```text
PUT /api/links/:id
```

### Backend create path

- route matched in `lib/router.js`
- payload validated and sanitized in `lib/links.js`
- new link inserted into the `links` table

### Backend update path

- route matched in `lib/router.js`
- current link is loaded from the `links` table
- merged payload is re-sanitized
- duplicate URL conflict is checked
- document is updated

### Browser result

- form message updates to success or error
- duplicate archived links offer a restore action

## Flow 5: Browse library

### User action

The user opens the browse page or changes:

- search text
- status filter
- sort mode
- page number

### Frontend path

`public/js/browse.js` sends:

```text
GET /api/links?...query params...
```

### Backend path

`lib/router.js` calls `parseLinkListQuery()` from `lib/utils.js`, then passes the parsed query to `readLinks()` in `lib/links.js`.

### Query building behavior

The backend can filter by:

- active vs deleted
- status
- tag
- search text
- updated-after timestamp

Search text matches titles, notes, URLs, hosts, tags, and dates.

It can sort by:

- `updatedAt`
- `createdAt`
- `date`
- `title`

Pinned items are always sorted first.

### Review queue

`GET /api/links/review` returns at most five saved or unread links. Due
reminders are ordered first. Remaining slots use the oldest links that are at
least 14 days old, have no future reminder, and have no meaningful action.

Editing a note, marking useful, or soft-archiving sets `firstMeaningfulAt` once.
Opening or snoozing leaves it unchanged.

### Database activity

- fetches matching `links`
- counts total matching documents

### Browser result

The browse page re-renders:

- rows
- counts
- pagination
- tag chips
- unread badge

## Flow 6: Inline status change on browse page

### User action

The user taps the status dot in a row.

### Frontend path

`public/js/browse.js` cycles status through:

```text
saved -> unread -> useful -> saved
```

Then sends:

```text
PUT /api/links/:id
```

with the updated link object.

### Backend path

`lib/router.js` -> `updateLink()` in `lib/links.js`

### Database activity

- loads the current document
- re-sanitizes and updates it
- refreshes `updatedAt`

### Browser result

- row status updates immediately after success
- unread badge refreshes

## Flow 7: Pin or unpin a link

### User action

The user presses the pin button on a row.

### Frontend path

`public/js/browse.js` sends:

```text
PUT /api/links/:id
```

with `pinned` toggled.

### Backend path

Same update flow as other full-link updates.

### Result

The page reloads the current list so sort order reflects the new pinned state.

## Flow 8: Bulk status update

### User action

The user enters select mode, selects rows, and chooses a new status.

### Frontend path

`public/js/browse.js` sends:

```text
PATCH /api/links/bulk
```

with:

- `ids`
- `status`

### Backend path

`lib/router.js` -> `bulkUpdateStatus()` in `lib/links.js`

### Database activity

- updates all matching active links in one `updateMany()` call

### Browser result

- selection mode exits
- current page reloads
- unread badge refreshes

## Flow 9: Soft delete and archive view

### Soft delete

From browse, a delete action sends:

```text
DELETE /api/links/:id
```

Backend behavior:

- sets `deletedAt`
- sets `status` to `archived`
- clears `pinned`
- refreshes `updatedAt`

### Archive loading

`public/js/archive.js` requests:

```text
GET /api/links?status=deleted
```

This returns soft-deleted links only.

### Restore

Archive restore sends:

```text
POST /api/links/restore/:id
```

Backend behavior:

- sets `deletedAt` back to `null`
- restores `status` to `saved` when previous status is `archived`
- refreshes `updatedAt`

### Hard delete

Archive hard delete sends:

```text
DELETE /api/links/:id?hardDelete=true
```

This removes the document completely.

## Flow 10: Import links from pasted lines

### User action

The user pastes lines into the editor import area.

### Frontend path

`public/js/editor.js`:

1. parses each line into URL and optional title
2. optionally calls `/api/fetch-title` for missing titles
3. sends one batch request:

```text
POST /api/links/import
```

### Backend path

`lib/router.js` -> `importLinks()` in `lib/links.js`

### Database activity

- loads all existing URLs
- skips duplicates
- sanitizes valid entries
- inserts new links one by one

### Browser result

Import summary is shown to the user.

## Flow 11: Import browser bookmarks HTML

### User action

The user uploads a bookmarks HTML file in the editor page.

### Frontend path

The browser reads the file and sends:

```text
POST /api/links/import-bookmarks
```

with the raw HTML.

### Backend path

`lib/router.js`:

1. validates the body
2. calls `parseBookmarksHtml()` in `lib/links.js`
3. passes parsed links into `importLinks()`

### Result

Only valid `http` and `https` bookmark entries are imported.

## Flow 12: Export links

### User action

The user clicks export.

### Frontend path

Browser navigates to:

```text
GET /api/links/export
```

### Backend path

`lib/router.js` -> `readAllLinksForExport()` in `lib/links.js`

### Database activity

- fetches all links
- sorts by `updatedAt` descending

### Response

Returns downloadable JSON.

Important detail:

- export includes all links, not only active ones
- plain-text notes are included in JSON export and import

## Flow 13: Tag chip loading

### User action

The browse page loads.

### Frontend path

`public/js/browse.js` requests:

```text
GET /api/tags?limit=15
```

### Backend path

`lib/router.js` -> `readTagCounts()` in `lib/links.js`

### Database activity

SQL query using `unnest(tags)`:

- filters active links
- unnests the tags array
- groups by tag
- sorts by count
- limits results

### Browser result

Top tags render as one-tap chips.

## Flow 14: Stats and unread badge

### User action

Pages load or certain actions complete.

### Frontend path

`public/js/shared.js` requests:

```text
GET /api/stats
```

### Backend path

`lib/router.js` performs several count queries.

### Database activity

Counts active links by status:

- total
- unread
- saved
- useful
- archived

### Browser result

- unread badge updates in navigation
- home dashboard stats can render from the same endpoint

## Flow 15: Link health check

### User action

The user presses “Check links” on the browse page.

### Frontend path

The frontend requests:

```text
GET /api/links/check-health
```

### Backend path

`lib/router.js`:

1. loads recent active links
2. validates that each URL points to a public address
3. performs batched `HEAD` requests
4. records status or failure reason

### Result shape

Each result may include:

- `ok: true` and HTTP status
- or `ok: false` with errors like:
  - `blocked`
  - `timeout`
  - `unreachable`
  - `failed`

### Browser result

The browse page can surface broken or unreachable links.

## Auth resolution flow

When an authenticated API request arrives, the backend checks auth in this order:

1. bearer token from `Authorization` header
2. session cookie

This means the same backend can serve:

- the web UI through cookies
- native clients through bearer tokens

## URL normalization flow

When a link is created or updated, URL normalization happens before storage.

Normalization currently includes:

- removing tracking parameters like `utm_*`, `fbclid`, and `gclid`
- removing fragment identifiers
- stripping some auth-related query parameters on login-like URLs
- deriving a clean `host`

This means the stored URL may differ slightly from the raw pasted URL.

## Error flow

Most route handlers follow this pattern:

1. parse and validate request
2. call domain logic
3. catch thrown errors
4. respond with either:
   - explicit `statusCode` and `payload`
   - or a generic fallback error

Typical API errors include:

- `400` validation or bad request
- `401` auth failure
- `404` missing link
- `409` duplicate link
- `429` login rate limit
- `500` unexpected server error

## Data flow strengths

The current design works well because:

- request flow is easy to trace end to end
- backend logic is centralized in a few clear modules
- the same API supports both browser and future mobile clients
- PostgreSQL schema is simple and sync-friendly

## Current flow weaknesses

A few flows are starting to show strain:

### Full-document updates from the frontend

Several UI actions send a full link payload for a small field change like:

- status
- pinned

This works, but more focused patch-style endpoints would reduce coupling.

### `getLinks()` on edit page

The editor currently loads all links and finds one item client-side when editing.

A future improvement would be a dedicated endpoint like:

```text
GET /api/links/:id
```

### Router growth

`lib/router.js` is doing more and more orchestration. Splitting route groups would make flow easier to maintain.

## Summary

The real current data flow in Link Nest is straightforward:

- page script sends API request
- router validates and dispatches
- domain logic sanitizes and applies business rules
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) stores or reads data
- JSON comes back
- page script re-renders the UI

That simplicity is one of the app’s strongest architectural traits right now.
