# Link Nest Architecture

Last updated: 2026-04-14

This document explains how Link Nest is structured, how requests move through the system, and why the project is organized this way.

## Overview

Link Nest is a private link library application with:

- a server-rendered static frontend using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- a small Node.js backend built on the built-in `http` module
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) for persistence
- two auth modes:
  - cookie sessions for the web UI
  - access tokens plus refresh tokens for mobile or external clients

The current shape is intentionally simple. It avoids a heavy framework, keeps control over request handling, and leaves room for future clients like iOS to use the same backend.

## High-Level Architecture

```text
Browser / future mobile client
        |
        v
   server.js
        |
        v
   lib/router.js
        |
        +--> lib/auth.js
        +--> lib/links.js
        +--> lib/title.js
        +--> lib/db.js
        +--> lib/utils.js
        +--> lib/http.js
        +--> lib/ratelimit.js
        |
        v
  Supabase (PostgreSQL)
```

Static assets are served from `public/`.

## Main Goals Of The Architecture

The project is designed around a few priorities:

- keep the backend simple enough to understand deeply
- support both website and API clients from the same codebase
- make link data durable and sync-friendly
- keep security basics built into the default flow
- avoid framework complexity until it is clearly needed

## Runtime Entry Point

### `server.js`

`server.js` is the application entry point.

It is responsible for:

- loading config from `lib/config.js`
- connecting to Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- ensuring the initial admin user exists
- starting the HTTP server exported from `lib/router.js`
- applying a 30-second socket timeout to reduce stalled connections
- closing the pg pool cleanly on `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`

This file stays intentionally small. It boots the app, then hands real request work to the router.

## Request Flow

A typical request follows this path:

1. the HTTP server receives the request
2. `lib/router.js` parses the URL and method
3. auth checks run if the route is protected
4. request body parsing and validation happen as needed
5. domain logic is delegated to `lib/auth.js`, `lib/links.js`, or `lib/title.js`
6. database operations happen through collections initialized in `lib/db.js`
7. response helpers in `lib/http.js` send JSON, text, redirects, or files

This keeps responsibilities separated:

- routing decides what should happen
- domain modules decide how it should happen
- HTTP helpers decide how it is returned

## Backend Modules

### `lib/config.js`

Centralizes environment-based configuration.

It defines:

- port and project paths
- Supabase connection URL
- auth cookie name and TTL values
- JWT settings
- admin bootstrap credentials
- URL and entry limits
- proxy trust behavior
- protected and public pages

It also fails fast when required values are missing, especially `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`.

### `lib/db.js`

Owns the Supabase (PostgreSQL) connection pool and startup logic.

Responsibilities:

- create and export a `pg` Pool connected to Supabase
- export a `query(sql, params)` helper used by all domain modules
- clean up expired sessions and refresh tokens on startup
- create or update the initial admin user

The database layer is intentionally thin. It does not try to be an ORM. SQL queries stay visible and direct in each domain module.

### `lib/router.js`

This is the main HTTP controller.

It handles:

- route matching
- request parsing
- auth enforcement
- endpoint orchestration
- static file delivery
- fallback behavior for protected pages and login redirects

The router exposes both:

- website-facing routes like `/`, `/browse.html`, `/login.html`
- API routes like `/api/links`, `/api/login`, `/api/fetch-title`

The same router supports both web and API clients, which is why auth is checked in a way that can return either JSON errors or browser redirects.

### `lib/auth.js`

Handles authentication and token/session management.

It supports two parallel auth systems:

#### 1. Cookie sessions for the website

- user logs in through `/api/login`
- server verifies credentials
- server creates a session token
- token hash is stored in the `sessions` table
- raw token is sent back as an HTTP-only cookie
- protected web pages use this cookie automatically

#### 2. Bearer tokens for mobile or external clients

- user logs in through `/api/auth/token`
- server returns a JWT access token and opaque refresh token
- refresh tokens are stored hashed in the `refresh_tokens` table
- `/api/auth/refresh` rotates refresh tokens
- `/api/auth/logout` revokes refresh tokens

This split is one of the strongest parts of the architecture because it keeps the browser UX simple while still preparing the backend for native clients.

### `lib/links.js`

This is the core link domain module.

Responsibilities:

- create links
- update links
- soft delete and restore links
- hard delete when requested
- import links
- export links
- read lists with filters and pagination
- fetch popular tags
- perform bulk status changes
- fetch title metadata for a URL

This module represents the real product behavior. If the app grows, this file will likely be the first place that benefits from splitting into smaller submodules.

### `lib/title.js`

Handles link title extraction and metadata fetching.

It does more than a naive page fetch:

- checks oEmbed providers for supported hosts
- streams only the HTML head when possible
- detects charset from headers or meta tags
- extracts meta titles and raw document titles
- decodes HTML entities
- tries to clean noisy titles

This is a good example of backend value. The app is not just storing URLs, it is normalizing and improving them.

### `lib/utils.js`

Contains shared normalization and validation logic.

Examples:

- URL normalization
- host derivation
- tag normalization
- status normalization
- list query parsing
- entry sanitization
- public URL checks to reduce SSRF risk
- user-safe object shaping

This file acts as the shared rules layer. A lot of product consistency depends on it.

### `lib/http.js`

Provides response helpers and security headers.

It standardizes:

- JSON responses
- plain text responses
- redirects
- static file responses
- request body parsing

It also applies security headers such as:

- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `X-Frame-Options`
- `X-Content-Type-Options`
- `Referrer-Policy`
- `Strict-Transport-Security`

### `lib/ratelimit.js`

Provides lightweight in-memory login rate limiting.

It is currently focused on auth protection:

- tracks failed login attempts by IP
- locks repeated failures for a time window
- optionally trusts `X-Forwarded-For` only when `TRUSTED_PROXY` is enabled

This is simple but appropriate for a small private app.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend lives in `public/` and is intentionally framework-free.

### HTML pages

Main pages:

- `index.html` for quick add and recent links
- `browse.html` for library management
- `editor.html` for add and edit flows
- `archive.html` for deleted items
- `login.html` for authentication
- `offline.html` for PWA offline fallback

### Frontend JavaScript

Scripts are separated by page responsibility:

- `shared.js` contains common helpers, logout flow, unread badge updates, service worker registration, and pull-to-refresh support
- `home.js` powers quick add and recent items
- `browse.js` powers search, sorting, bulk actions, tag chips, pinning, and status cycling
- `editor.js` powers create, edit, import, and title fetching flows
- `archive.js` powers restore and hard delete for archived items
- `login.js` powers the sign-in form

`shared.js` exposes a `window.LinkNest` namespace used by all page scripts:

- `apiFetch` — authenticated fetch wrapper
- `getLinks` — fetch links with query params
- `setMessage` — show success/error message in UI
- `parseTags` — normalize tag string input
- `queryParam` — read URL query params
- `updateUnreadBadge()` — refresh the unread count pill in nav
- `initPullToRefresh(onRefresh)` — attach pull-to-refresh gesture

Keyboard shortcuts: `/` focuses the search box, `Esc` clears it.

### Responsive UI

- **Check links** and **Export** buttons are hidden at ≤768px
- Title truncation: 70 chars desktop / 55 chars mobile (≤768px breakpoint)

This is a simple multi-page app architecture rather than a single-page app.

That choice has tradeoffs:

### Benefits

- easier to understand
- no frontend build step
- low complexity
- pages remain directly inspectable

### Costs

- more manual DOM code
- shared UI behavior must be maintained carefully
- state management can become repetitive as features grow

For the current size of the project, this tradeoff is reasonable.

## Data Model

The main entity is a link document.

Current fields include:

- `id`
- `url`
- `title`
- `host`
- `date`
- `tags`
- `status`
- `pinned`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`
- `deletedAt`

### Why this model works well

- `id` is a UUID generated in application code, not a database serial
- `deletedAt` enables soft delete and future sync behavior
- timestamps support incremental sync and conflict-aware clients later
- `host` improves search and display
- `status` keeps the product focused on revisit workflow, not just storage

Related tables:

- `users`
- `sessions`
- `refresh_tokens`

## Authentication Architecture

The system intentionally supports both browser and API authentication.

### Browser flow

Best for:
- the built-in website

Properties:
- cookie-based
- HTTP-only session token
- browser-friendly redirects for protected pages

### API flow

Best for:
- iOS app
- automation clients
- future integrations

Properties:
- short-lived access token
- longer-lived refresh token
- refresh token rotation
- stateless access token verification plus database-backed refresh control

This dual-mode design is one of the main architectural decisions that makes the backend reusable.

## Security Design

Several important security controls are already present:

- password hashing with `bcryptjs`
- session and refresh token hashing before storage
- minimum secret length enforcement for JWT secret
- HTTP-only cookies
- login rate limiting
- CSP and other security headers
- URL validation to block private or reserved network targets
- no trust in forwarded IP headers unless explicitly enabled
- protected route checks for both HTML pages and JSON endpoints
- request body size limit in `parseBody`
- socket timeout on the server

This is a solid baseline for a private app.

## Static Delivery And PWA Behavior

Static assets are served directly from `public/`.

A service worker adds:

- precaching for public assets
- offline page fallback
- runtime caching for navigation responses
- network-only handling for API requests

This gives the app lightweight PWA behavior without adding a frontend framework.

## Why The Current Architecture Works

The current structure is strong because it matches the product stage.

It is:

- small enough to understand fully
- modular enough to extend
- backend-first
- future-client aware
- simple to deploy

It avoids premature abstraction while still separating concerns in useful ways.

## Current Architectural Limits

The project is good, but some limits are starting to show.

### 1. `router.js` is growing into a large controller

As more routes are added, this file will become harder to maintain.

A likely next step is splitting route handlers into domain route modules, for example:

- `routes/auth.js`
- `routes/links.js`
- `routes/system.js`

### 2. `links.js` mixes several responsibilities

It currently handles:

- CRUD
- import logic
- export logic
- tag stats
- bulk operations
- title-related helper behavior

That is manageable now, but eventually it may want smaller modules such as:

- `links/service.js`
- `links/import.js`
- `links/query.js`

### 3. frontend state is manually coordinated

The current vanilla JS approach is fine, but as UX grows, repeated fetch/update/render logic will get harder to maintain.

### 4. there is no test layer yet

For a backend with auth, normalization, URL safety, and import logic, tests would add a lot of confidence.

The highest-value early tests would be:

- auth token/session behavior
- URL normalization and SSRF blocking
- link sanitization
- list query parsing
- import behavior

## Recommended Next Architectural Improvements

If you want to strengthen the architecture without overengineering it, the best next moves are:

1. split `router.js` into route modules
2. add a small test suite for core backend rules
3. separate link domain logic into query/import/write modules
4. add structured error helpers instead of repeating route-level error shaping
5. document data flow for the future mobile client

## Summary

Link Nest uses a clean, practical architecture:

- plain Node.js HTTP server
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) persistence
- modular backend helpers
- multi-page vanilla frontend
- browser and API auth support
- security-aware URL and auth handling

The design is strongest in two areas:

- it is simple enough to reason about end to end
- it is already shaped for future mobile clients

That makes it a good foundation for a personal product that can grow without needing an early rewrite.
